# Abide

A client portal for mental health practitioners. Clients complete regular check-ins, track their progress over time, and access resources assigned by their practitioner. The admin side gives the practitioner a clear view of each client's progress and the tools to manage content and questionnaires.

**Live demo:** https://honest-portal.vercel.app/

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** — built with Vite
- **Redux Toolkit** — app state (questionnaires, responses, resources, theme); RTK Query for external data
- **Supabase** — authentication and database
- **MUI v9** — component library _ custom react components
- **SCSS modules** — component-level styles with a shared design token system
- **Recharts** — progress charts
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library** — unit and accessibility tests
- **Biome** — linting and formatting

## Local development

Requires a Supabase project. Add a `.env` file at the root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

```bash
npm install
npm run start       # dev server
npm run build       # production build → dist/
npm run test        # Vitest in watch mode
npm run sync-tokens # sync SCSS $variables → CSS custom properties
```

## Architecture

**Auth** uses a dual-layer approach. `AuthContext` (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) is the live source of truth — it holds the Supabase session, user profile, and role. Components consume this via `useAuth()`. Redux slices handle the rest of the app state independently.

**Routing** splits into two role-based trees in `App.tsx`. `ProtectedRoute` accepts a `requiredRole` prop and redirects if the signed-in user doesn't match — admins are always redirected away from client routes and vice versa.

**Styling** uses SCSS design tokens (`src/styles/_colors.scss`, `_spacing.scss`, `_typography.scss`) exposed as CSS custom properties in `src/index.scss`. Dark mode is a `.dark` class on `<html>` — all colour changes are in CSS, no JS colour logic. Run `npm run sync-tokens` after editing token files.

**Supabase** — client singleton at `src/lib/supabase.js`. Key tables are typed in `src/models/globalTypes.tsx`: `users`, `questionnaires`, `questions`, `questionnaire_assignments`, `responses`, `resources`.
